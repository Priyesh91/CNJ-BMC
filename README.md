# Central-Jersey-Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Book-and-Movie-Club
CNJ Sci-Fi/Fantasy BMC project is a front-end web application designed by a team of four, for the club members to have a central source of information. The club members had to refer to three separate websites for their club Goodreads, Meetup and Google books. In this project we had centralized this information through the use of Meetup API to pull up information on the group meeting date and their current reads and past reads, IDreamBooks API to pull up critic reviews and links to the reviews about the books and Google books API is used to give members access to preview the first few chapters of the book. As the team facilitator I helped team members in debugging code to ensure the project met the deadline. I was also responsible for ensuring proper Git versioning, resolving merge conflicts and establishing proper connection to firebase to collect member information such as name, Goodreads/Meetup usernames and book suggestions for future reads.
